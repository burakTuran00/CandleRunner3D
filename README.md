# CandleRunner3D

I made the Candle Runner. I used the Unity Editor and C# for coding. I want to explain What I did.

-Player Movement.

-Power Ups

-Obstacles.

-Game State.

-UI.

-Joystick.

There is an issue I want to tell. This kind of games are limetless. 

I didn't strive to do some level. There is a just one level and menu system.
